1 hello in this tutorial y'' revise about git
2 ready up your files open terminal any bash or vs terminal
3 if in bash see pwd (directory) got to respective file Mandatory
4 enter git init then .git file appears it may be hidden if so go to setting and search for exclude untick .git 
5 configure username and email as git config --global user.name 'xyz' amd git config --global user.email'xyz@email.com'
6 to modify it git config -- user.name 'abd' and same for email 
7 to delete username git config --unset user.name and same for email
8 to see the username git config --get user.name >> latest username once check out readme.txt
9 now all you need to do is write >> save>> add>> commit>>
10 add all >> git add .  while add specific git add 'filename'
11  commit syntax git commit -m ''
note git tracks only folders with content if the folder is empty it do not tracks
eg say there are two folder source and image now if .gitkeep then that folder won't be ignored 
even its empty 
12 to track all files being tracked by git >> git ls-files
13 branching 
create branch git branch <branchname>
access branch git checkout <branchname>
oneliner git checkout -b <branchname>
make changes to your code staying on bracnchname 
come to main and merge which is a fast merge

more than one branch 
let blue n orange are two branch now they are simultaneously working 
and modifying files if they are working on separate file then 
there won't be issues but if they modify same file then error occurs
