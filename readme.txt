If you’ve unset the username but it still shows a username when you run git config --get user.name, it's likely because Git is falling back to another configuration level where the username is still set.

Here’s how Git’s configuration works, and why you might still see the username:

Git Configuration Levels
Local Configuration: Settings specific to the current repository. Stored in the .git/config file inside the repository.
Global Configuration: Settings that apply to all repositories for the current user. Stored in the ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config file (on Unix-like systems) or in C:/Users/<YourUsername>/.gitconfig on Windows.
System Configuration: System-wide settings that apply to all users and repositories. Stored in Git's system configuration file, usually located in /etc/gitconfig.
When you unset a username in one configuration level (e.g., local), Git will look at the higher levels (e.g., global or system) to retrieve the username.

What Could Be Happening:
Unset the Local Username: If you ran git config --unset user.name in a specific repository, you only removed the local setting for that repository.

If you have a global or system-wide username set, Git will use that value when you run git config --get user.name.

How to Check Where the Username is Set
You can explicitly check the username at each configuration level:

Check Local Configuration (for the current repository):

bash
Copy code
git config --local --get user.name
Check Global Configuration:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get user.name
Check System Configuration:

bash
Copy code
git config --system --get user.name
If the username shows up at the global or system level, that’s why Git still has a value for user.name even though you’ve unset it locally.

How to Completely Unset the Username
To completely remove the username at any configuration level, you need to unset it at that specific level:

To unset locally (for the current repository):

bash
Copy code
git config --unset user.name
To unset globally (for all repositories):

bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset user.name
To unset system-wide:

bash
Copy code
git config --system --unset user.name
Make sure that the username is removed from all levels if you want it completely unset.

Check All Configuration Levels
To see all the Git configuration settings across all levels, you can run:

bash
Copy code
git config --list --show-origin
This will show you the file location where each setting is defined (local, global, system), helping you trace where the username is coming from

o check the list of files that are being tracked by Git in your repository, you can use the following command:

List All Tracked Files:
bash
Copy code
git ls-files
This will show all files in the repository that Git is currently tracking. These files are either committed or staged for the next commit.

Additional Options for git ls-files:
List Only Modified Tracked Files: To see only the tracked files that have been modified but not yet committed, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git ls-files -m
List Ignored Files (those listed in .gitignore): To see files that are ignored by Git based on your .gitignore file, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git ls-files --others -i --exclude-standard
List Untracked Files (files not tracked by Git): To see files that are not tracked by Git (i.e., files not staged or committed), you can use:

bash
Copy code
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
Example:
Running git ls-files will give you an output like this:

bash
Copy code
src/file1.txt
src/file2.txt
README.md
.gitignore
These are all the files that Git is currently tracking in the repository.

also remember 
No, Git will not track the ball and cat folders if the .git directory is inside the apple folder. Each .git folder marks the root of a Git repository, and Git only tracks files and folders within the directory where .git is initialized, and its subdirectories.

Explanation:
If .git is inside apple, then the apple folder is a Git repository. Git will track only the files and subdirectories within apple (and its subdirectories).
The ball and cat folders, which are outside of apple, will not be tracked by the apple repository, because they are outside the scope of the Git repository.
Example Structure:
kotlin
Copy code
gittutorial/
  ├── apple/         <-- .git folder is here, Git tracks this directory
  ├── ball/          <-- Not tracked by Git, outside of apple
  └── cat/           <-- Not tracked by Git, outside of apple
What Git Tracks:
Git only tracks files and directories inside apple (where the .git directory is located).
The ball and cat directories are separate and outside of the Git repository’s scope.
To Track ball and cat:
If you want Git to track ball and cat, you would need to initialize a Git repository at the gittutorial level, which is the parent of all three folders:

Move the .git folder to gittutorial (or initialize a new repository):

bash
Copy code
cd gittutorial
git init
Now, Git will track everything inside gittutorial, including apple, ball, and cat.

New Structure After Moving .git:
csharp
Copy code
gittutorial/         <-- .git folder is here
  ├── apple/         <-- Tracked by Git
  ├── ball/          <-- Tracked by Git
  └── cat/           <-- Tracked by Git
Now, Git will track all three folders: apple, ball, and cat.

Summary:
If .git is in apple, Git will only track apple and its contents.
ball and cat won't be tracked unless the .git folder is moved to the common parent (gittutorial), or you initialize a separate Git repository at the gittutorial level.
